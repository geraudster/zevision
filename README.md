# Face recognition and analysis & Object detection API

**This project provides an API for face detection, sentiment analysis and object detection that can be easily used by developers in custom-made applications.**

The models are based on state of the art computer vision libraries.

A REST API allows for the training and usage of the models.

It can run natively on the machine or in a docker container.

### Environnement Setup & Installation

#### Locally
On a Ubuntu 16.04 terminal, while in the repository's directory, launch `sudo bash setup.sh`- the installation of all the necessary tools would be underway after you enter your root password.

Support for Windows and MacOS is coming soon.

#### Using Docker

Install docker as described [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/), then build `face-recognition` image:

```
docker build -t face-recognition .
```

See [here](https://github.com/zenika-open-source/zevision/tree/master/api#docker) for an example of `docker run`.
